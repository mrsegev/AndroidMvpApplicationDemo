# AndroidMvpApplicationDemo

This is a very simple, basic concept application that shows Android MVP implementation.  
The application shows the current weather temperature in selected cities around the world. 
  
####Key points:  

* Using base abstract classes to support MVP methodology while   
	avoiding Activity leaks by releasing the view(=activity) when it's no 	longer needed.

* Provides built-in cacheing mechanism to handle configuration changes.
 
* Trying to keep things as simple and lightweight as possible.

####Libraries in use:

*	Retrofit
*	RxJava
*	RxAndroid
*	Gson 

####Todo's:

* Add tests.
* Improve the implementation over time.
